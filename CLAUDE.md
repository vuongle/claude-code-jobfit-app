# JobFit

## What this is

JobFit helps job seekers close the gap between the CV they have and the role they want. The user uploads a CV and gives us a job description — pasted in, or as a link we fetch ourselves.

We score it immediately. No questions first, no setup, no conversation: the CV goes in, the result comes back. That result is a weighted score, a per-category breakdown, and a set of gaps rendered inline on the user's own CV.

Only after that, and only if the user presses Optimise, does a conversation open. That conversation is scoped to the gaps we already
found — it asks about one specific missing detail at a time. It is not a general assistant and it does not interview the user from scratch.

There are no CV templates in this product. We read the document the user gives us and we work on that document.

The product never invents experience. It surfaces what is weak, asks the user to fill the blanks, and rephrases what is genuinely there. Everything in this codebase should respect that boundary.

Assets live in two places:

- `rubric.json` — scoring categories, weights and criteria (project root)
- `fixtures/` — CV and JD pairs with expected results, used to prove the
  rubric behaves consistently. Index inlined below.

@fixtures/index.json

Read `rubric.json` and the documents under `fixtures/` only when a task actually touches them. Do not pull them into context by default.

## How features get built

Each unit of work arrives as a GitHub Issue. For every one of them:

1. Read the issue through the GitHub tools — do not guess at scope
2. Run the full feature-dev workflow. All seven phases. No shortcuts, including the review and test phase
3. Cover the work with unit tests and integration tests, then fix everything those tests surface
4. Open a Pull Request through the GitHub tools when the work is done

If an issue is ambiguous, stop and ask before writing code. Vague tickets are intentional here.

## Conventions

Be simple. Work in small steps and confirm each one before moving on.
Do not over-engineer. Do not write defensively for problems that are not in front of us. Use the current version of every API.

Python lives in a standard venv with pip. Activate the project venv before running anything. `requirements.txt` is the only declaration of dependencies — nothing gets installed without landing there. Prefer short modules and clear docstrings over inline comments.

No emoji. Not in code, not in `print`, not in logs. Keep the README short.

When something breaks: prove the problem exists before touching it, find the root cause, test one hypothesis at a time, and reproduce it consistently. No workarounds for causes we do not understand yet.

## Working with the model

All scoring and rewriting know-how lives in the `cv-rubric` skill. That skill is the single source of truth for:

- the scoring rubric and its weights
- the structured output schema returned by a scoring call
- the rules that govern how CV content may be rewritten

The skill contains no code. It describes what a correct result looks like, not how to produce one. The how belongs here:

- Model calls speak the OpenAI-compatible chat-completions protocol. By default they go to OpenRouter and are authorised with `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `.env` at the project root. Any OpenAI-compatible server works too: set `LLM_BASE_URL` (for example a local Ollama instance) and `LLM_MODEL`; `LLM_API_KEY` overrides auth when the endpoint needs one
- Scoring and rewriting are two separate calls with two separate schemas. Do not merge them into one
- Both use Structured Outputs, so the frontend can render the breakdown, the gap list and the keyword sets without parsing free text
- Scoring must be deterministic. The same CV and the same JD produce the same score, every time. `fixtures/` exists to prove that, and a change that breaks it is a broken change
- Anything that can be computed in code is computed in code. Do not ask the model for work that arithmetic or string matching already answers
- Scoring splits into two model calls: a JD analysis (skills, phrases, experience requirements) and a CV judgment (experience, formatting, gaps, half-credits). Everything else — keyword matching, bullet quantification, weighting, bands — is code

Do not hand-roll a scoring prompt or a rewrite prompt. If the skill does not cover a case, extend the skill rather than working around it.

## Architecture

Ship the whole thing as a single Docker image. Resist the pull toward docker-compose and a container per service — this project does not need it.

- `backend/` — Python, FastAPI, dependencies pinned in `requirements.txt`, developed inside a standard venv
- `frontend/` — Next.js. Build it statically and let FastAPI serve it if that arrangement holds up
- SQLite, created inside the container. Early tickets may recreate it on every boot; once accounts land, the data has to survive restarts so users keep their application history

The app answers on http://localhost:8000

Scripts go in `scripts/`, one pair per platform:

scripts/start-mac.sh scripts/stop-mac.sh
scripts/start-linux.sh scripts/stop-linux.sh
scripts/start-windows.ps1 scripts/stop-windows.ps1

## Visual language

Score colour is meaning, not decoration. A user should read the result
before reading a single number.

| Token   | Hex       | Used for                                        |
| ------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Strong  | `#16a34a` | score ≥ 75, matched keywords, rewritten bullets |
| Partial | `#ecad0a` | score 50–74, weak bullets worth improving       |
| Weak    | `#dc2626` | score < 50, requirements absent from the CV     |
| Primary | `#209dd7` | actions, links, active states                   |
| Ink     | `#032147` | headings and body emphasis                      |
| Muted   | `#888888` | secondary text, helper copy                     |

Score breakdown renders as a ring for the overall figure and horizontal bars per category. Gaps render inline on the user's own CV using the three score colours above, not as a separate list.

## Status

### #1 — Rubric and fixtures (PR #5)

`rubric.json` at the repo root carries the five weighted categories from the `cv-rubric` skill, each with a measurement and a scoring rule. `fixtures/` holds three CV-JD pairs — one per score band — each with an `expected.json` giving score ranges, required matched/missing keywords, and required gaps:

- `case-01-backend-strong` — senior backend engineer, strong match
- `case-02-marketing-partial` — digital marketing manager, partial match; this is the designated demo case, and it additionally ships a `cv.pdf` plus a `build_pdf.py`
- `case-03-data-weak` — data analyst applying for a data scientist role, weak match

`fixtures/index.json` lists all three. A pypdf parity test at `backend/tests/test_pdf_md_parity.py` guards the extractor → scorer seam for case-02 by asserting canonical text extracted from `cv.pdf` matches canonical text of `cv.md`; deterministic scoring turns that into "same score".

### #2 — V1 technical foundation (PR #6)

Whole app skeleton up. FastAPI serves the API and the built frontend from a single process on port 8000.

- `POST /api/session` — fake login; creates a `users` row from a name and returns the id
- `POST /api/uploads` — multipart PDF + `jd_text`; extracts text with pypdf and stores the pair in `uploads`
- `GET /api/health` — liveness probe

Frontend is Next.js 15 App Router with Tailwind and `output: 'export'`. `/` is the login page (name field, localStorage session). `/app` is the authenticated screen: CV upload, JD paste, extracted-text preview, and a disabled Score button that flags scoring as the next ticket. Visual tokens from the table above flow through CSS variables so all colour choices live in one place.

SQLite lives at `/data/jobfit.sqlite3` inside the container. Schema (`users`, `uploads`, `scores`) is dropped and recreated on every boot — that changes when real accounts land.

### #3 — Chấm điểm và tối ưu CV (part 1: scoring core, in review)

Scoring is wired up. `POST /api/score` scores a stored upload and returns the cv-rubric structured result: overall score, band, per-category breakdown with evidence, gaps with severity and suggestion, matched/missing keywords, and the weak-bullet list.

The pipeline is hybrid, by the compute-in-code rule:

- Code computes literal keyword matching (case-insensitive, alias-aware, word-boundary so Java does not match JavaScript), the quantified-bullet ratio (any concrete non-year number counts), the weighted overall, and the band
- Two model calls at temperature 0 cover the judgment: one analyses the JD into short canonical keywords and experience requirements, one judges experience/formatting deductions, half-credits for adjacent skills, and gaps. Prompts quote `rubric.json` verbatim
- `backend/app/llm.py` speaks the OpenAI-compatible chat-completions protocol: OpenRouter by default, or any OpenAI-compatible server via `LLM_BASE_URL`/`LLM_MODEL` in `.env` (the start scripts pass `--env-file .env` to the container)

The `/app` screen now scores on click and renders the result: score ring, per-category bars, keyword chips, gap cards, and the user's own CV annotated inline — matched keywords in strong green, non-quantified bullets in partial amber, missing keywords as weak-red chips above the CV.

Tests: unit tests cover the code-computed parts and schema assembly; API tests fake the model; `backend/tests/test_scoring_fixtures.py` runs all three fixture cases against a live endpoint (skipped without `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`/`LLM_BASE_URL`) and asserts the `expected.json` ranges, required keywords and gaps, plus score repeatability. Still open on this ticket: JD link fetching, the Optimise conversation, live preview, and download — planned as two follow-up PRs.

Packaging is a single multi-stage Docker image (node builds the frontend, python serves both). `scripts/start-{mac,linux}.sh` / `scripts/start-windows.ps1` and matching `stop-*` counterparts wrap `docker build` and `docker run` with a `jobfit-data` named volume. The catch-all static route also serves the export's RSC `.txt` payloads and the built `404.html`, so in-app navigation stays client-side and unknown paths get a real 404 page.
